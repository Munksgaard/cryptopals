# cryptopals

This is a collection of Rust solutions to the
[cryptopals crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com/).

To run each solution, simply run `make` in the corresponding folder.

In addition to the folders in here, each of which correspond to a particular
challenge, completing these challenges has led to the creation of a number of
crypto and utility libraries:
